#### The Power of Decisions
* Sopranos moment: "More is lost to indecision, than to the wrong decision."
* The only incorrect choice is to not start.
	* There are no permanent consequences.
	* Learning another language is always easier after you learn your first.
* Make it easier: pick from the [TIOBE Top 5](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

### TIOBE
* Fun trivia: their name stands for "The Importance of Being Earnest"
* Software quality company
* Maintains list of languages & their relative use in the software industry
* I'd recommend any in the Top 5 
* There are some I wouldn't recommend in the top 10
---
### Having said that... (My Recommendation)
* I, personally, recommend Python.
* I like it. It was my first language.
* The Good:
	* Excellent documentation.
	* Made with usability in mind.
	* Industry standard.
	* Good ecosystem.
	* Batteries included.
* The Bad:
	* Slow.
	* Not async native; async available in the standard library.
	* Sub-par REPL.
* The Ugly:
	* Dynamic programming.
	* Significant whitespace.

### What Makes Languages Different?

* Different words to deal with the same things.
