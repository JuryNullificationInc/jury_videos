#### The Power of Decisions
* Sopranos moment: "More is lost to indecision, than to the wrong decision."
* The only incorrect choice is to not start.
	* There are no permanent consequences.
	* Learning another language is always easier after you learn your first.
* Make it easier: pick from the [TIOBE Top 5](https://www.tiobe.com/tiobe-index/).

### TIOBE
* Fun trivia: their name stands for "The Importance of Being Earnest"
* Software quality company
* Maintains list of languages & their relative use in the software industry
* I'd recommend any in the Top 5 
* There are some I wouldn't recommend in the top 10
---
### Having said that... (My Recommendation)
* I recommend Python.
* The Personal: I like it. It was my first language.
* The Good:
	* Excellent documentation.
	* Made with usability in mind.
	* Industry standard.
	* Good ecosystem.
	* Batteries included.
* The Bad:
	* Slow.
	* Not async native; async available in the standard library.
	* Sub-par REPL.
* The Ugly:
	* Dynamic programming.
	* Significant whitespace.

### What Makes Languages Different?

### Support

**(3/4) - (4/4): Exceptional**
**(1/4) - (2/4): Average**
**(0/4): Non-Existent**

* The best language is the one you can use.
* Nobody starts off being able to use a language well.
* Support enables you to go from "not having touched it" to "your best language."

---
### Support: Documentation

**(3/4) - (4/4): Exceptional**
**(1/4) - (2/4): Average**
**(0/4): Non-Existent**

* Does it have documentation?
* Are there enough topics covered that you feel you can use it as a one-stop guide to learning the language?
* Do the articles answer your questions deeply enough to be a one-stop guide to learning that topic?
* Can you read the documentation and make sense of it?

---
### Support: Standard library

**(3/4) - (4/4): Exceptional**
**(1/4) - (2/4): Average**
**(0/4): Non-Existent**

* Does it have a standard library?
* Add 1 to the score if it has implementations for at least half of the following: 
	* IO
	* File manipulation
	* HTTP requests
	* Random number generation
	* Date & time
	* Regular expressions
	* Interprocess communications
	* SSL
